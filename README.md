# 🎄🎄🎄 Advent of Code 2018 🎄🎄🎄  

Solutions to [Advent of Code 2018](https://adventofcode.com/) implemented in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org).
My goal was to try something new and learn a new language.

## Installing

Follow [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html) installation instructions.

## Running solutions

You can test individual solutions by running

```bash
$ cargo run
```

in each solvers directory.

Add your input files as `input.txt` in each days directory to run the code.

## Solutions
