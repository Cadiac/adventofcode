# 🎄🎄🎄 Advent of Code 2019 🎄🎄🎄  

Solutions to [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/) implemented in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org).
My goal is to try something new and learn a new language.

## Installing

Follow [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html) installation instructions.

## Running solutions

The project is split into separate binaries within one cargo project.

You can run individual solutions with

```bash
$ cargo run --bin day01
```

or run single days tests with

```bash
$ cargo test --bin day01
```

in root directory
